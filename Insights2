**2. How did the average review score change over time?**

The average review score (right Y-axis) remains relatively stable over the period from February 2017 to February 2018. It fluctuates slightly between 8 and 12, but there are no dramatic changes. This stability suggests that while the number of reviews increased, the average rating given by customers did not vary significantly.

Key Insights:
Stability: Throughout the entire period, the average review score remains relatively stable, mostly fluctuating between 9 and 11. This indicates a consistent level of customer satisfaction.
Minor Fluctuations: Although there are small peaks and troughs, these are not drastic enough to suggest any major changes in product quality or customer satisfaction.
Peak in October 2017: The highest average rating observed is around October 2017, aligning with a peak in the number of reviews. This could suggest a particularly successful period, possibly due to promotions, new releases, or improved customer experiences.
Post-Peak Stability: After the peak, the average rating declines slightly but stabilizes, indicating that while there may be seasonal or promotional influences, the overall customer satisfaction remains positive.
Business Implications:
Consistent Quality: The stable average rating suggests that the audiobooks maintain a consistent quality level that meets customer expectations.
Successful Periods: Identifying periods with higher average ratings (e.g., October 2017) can help understand what factors contributed to increased customer satisfaction and how to replicate this success.
Customer Feedback: Continuous monitoring of the average rating helps in understanding customer feedback and making necessary adjustments to maintain or improve product quality.
Summary:
The average review score shows stability over the period from February 2017 to February 2018, with minor fluctuations.
